My second portfolio design

To Do:

- Add descriptive comments to the project as needed

- Edit portfolio thumbnails to be centered on the page

- Add comments section to blog posts

- Fix the blog title to fit within the container without having too much
    white space

- Lock the footer to the bottom of the page

- Keep the header displayed on the page, even after scrolling past it's initial position
    - Show my logo element that links back to the main page when this happens

- Add a close button for the nav popout menu that's used for smaller resolutions

- Change the class/id names to correctly represent elements

- Incorporate Pods framework, starting with the individual project page
    - Remove anything related to Advanced Custom Fields

- Work on responsive stylings
    - Adjust the section spacing on the main page for smaller screens
    - Fix the top section splash image to display correctly at the lowest resolution
    - Fix the nav popout menu styling for the smaller resolutions
    - Adjust the responsive styling on the blog, 404, and search pages

- Build out blog section on the front page. will include it on the front page later

- Build out the portfolio project description page (statically or dynamically?)
