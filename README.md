# portfolio-02
*My second portfolio design*

**To Do:**
* Add descriptive comments to the project as needed
* Incorporate Pods framework
    * Pod structure has been written down (pods-structure.md)
* Change the class/id names to correctly represent elements
* Add a close button for the nav popout menu that's used for smaller resolutions
* Work on responsive stylings - Adjust the section spacing on the main page for smaller screens - Fix the top section splash image to display correctly at the lowest resolution - Fix the nav popout menu styling for the smaller resolutions - Adjust the responsive styling on the blog, 404, and search pages
* fix text background for bullet points(i think that's the target?)
