**To Do:**
** These tasks will carry over to the next version of the portfolio as needed **

* Change the class/id names to correctly represent elements
* Add a close button for the nav popout menu that's used for smaller resolutions
* Work on responsive stylings - Adjust the section spacing on the main page for smaller screens - Fix the top section splash image to display correctly at the lowest resolution - Fix the nav popout menu styling for the smaller resolutions - Adjust the responsive styling on the blog, 404, and search pages
* fix text background for bullet points in blog posts (i think that's the target?)

* Make the grid in the portfolio section more dynamic

* Try to use native wordpress syntax to pull up pods data on their pages

* Make the code link button on the project page unclickable when there is no available repository

* Check the spacing between the project page buttons and the title

* Study how the technologies icons are being looped through in the project page. Also, make the loop conditional.
    * The conditional may also have to be looked at with the front page portfolio section

* Fix the RPS Game images
* Fix the theme thumbnail image
* Check the other project images for accuracy
* See if the HTML Email project needs fixing again

* Maybe change the splash section
* Maybe look at a different effect for front page portfolio section hover
* Maybe add a white background to the technologies section of the project page
